# Search Functionality App

## Search Utility Function
- Use command `npm install` to install the dependencies 
- I have used JEST for testing. You can read all about (JEST here)[https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started]
- Run `yarn test` or `npm run test` and Jest will test the app
- the test file is `/search-utility-function/search_summaries.test.js`



## Search App
### URL Test: https://prashantsani.github.io/search-functionality/
- Built using `CREATE REACT APP`
- Commands:-
  - `yarn start`: Starts the development server.
  - `yarn run build`: Bundles the app into static files for production.
  - `yarn test`: Starts the test runner.
  - `yarn run eject`: Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
- To deploy the app to Github pages use `npm run deploy` command
- This app uses https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages to deploy to gitpages
