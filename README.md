# Search Functionality App

## Search Utility Function
- Use command `npm install` to install the dependencies 
- I have used JEST for testing. You can read all about (JEST here)[https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started]
- Run `yarn test` or `npm run test` and Jest will test the app
- the test file is `/search-utility-function/search_summaries.test.js`
